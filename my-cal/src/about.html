<p><strong>INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<div class="indent1">
<p>
<i>CMD TaskMaster</i> is a task and event-focused calendar application. It will be able to solve organizational challenges faced by the user(s) as either an individual or member of a community, company, or a group by providing an easy to use framework for events, project development, task distribution, and “to-do” lists with no specific deadline.

<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<div class="indent1">
<p>
Users will be able to create tasks and sub-tasks within time-windows/deadlines or until the task is actively marked as complete. Group features will also be part of this application as users will be able to assign and delegate tasks to other users in the group, accept tasks from other users, and invite users to their group. Critical to the app is the idea of nesting, particularly nested tasks and nested groups. For example, this software project is a task that can be subdivided into many sub-tasks, and the CS97 class is a group that is divided into subgroups. We hope to also include location services (with respective permissions) by extending the application to local events, where users could view public events around their area. Out of scope features that this application will not implement in the time allotted will be a completely public marketplace where users could post tasks for anyone to complete. Users must assign tasks to specific groups or other specific users. Also any kind of locational directions to event locations found on the app will be an out of scope feature that we will not implement. The app will merely be able to indicate the location of an event.

<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY STACK</strong></p>
<div class="indent1">
<p>
Our application utilizes React and additional APIs as well as Google Maps for mapping purposes. React is useful because it is not restricted to one OS and because it can be easily repurposed across web and mobile applications. A centralized GitHub repository holds our shared code. You can access our repository <a href="https://github.com/jrbronkar/TaskMaster">here</a>. We're currently using SQL for our database.
